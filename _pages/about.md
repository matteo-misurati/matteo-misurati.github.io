Greetings! I am an italian mathematician based in Ferrara working in non-commutative algebra, mostly on braided monoidal categories and quasi-Hopf algebras. My goal is to discover beautiful mathematical structures and encourage public interest in pure mathematics. 

This website contains the list of my [publications](https://matteo-misurati.github.io/publications/), the [slides of the talks](https://matteo-misurati.github.io/talks/) I have given at various conferences and a summary of my [teaching experiences](https://matteo-misurati.github.io/teaching/). You can also find my curriculum vitae [here](https://matteo-misurati.github.io/cv/).

For any question, don't hesitate to send me an email at: `matteo.misurati[at]unife.it`
