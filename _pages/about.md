Greetings! I am a mathematician based in Ferrara, Italy, working in non-commutative algebra, mostly on braided monoidal categories and quasi-Hopf algebras. I aim to discover beautiful structures and foster public interest in pure mathematics.

For any question, don't hesitate to send me an email at: `matteo.misurati[at]unife.it`
