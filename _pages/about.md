Greetings! I am an italian mathematician based in Ferrara working in non-commutative algebra, mostly on braided monoidal categories and quasi-Hopf algebras. My goal is to discover beautiful mathematical structures and encourage public interest in pure mathematics.

For any question, don't hesitate to send me an email at: `matteo.misurati[at]unife.it`
