abstract = {We complete the classification of the 6-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras, by proving that any such algebra is semisimple. As byproducts, we provide examples of 6-dimensional quasi-bialgebras that are not semisimple as algebras, as well as the concrete quasi-Hopf structures of the 6-dimensional semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras previously classified by Etingof and Gelaki in terms of their category of representations. In total there are 15 quasi-Hopf algebras in dimension 6 which are not pairwise twist equivalent.}

      abstract = {Inspired by the work of Radford, for $H$ an arbitrary quasi-Hopf algebra we describe all the Hopf algebras of dimension 
$2$ within the braided category of left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ and determine the biproduct quasi-Hopf algebras defined by them. 
Classes of such biproduct quasi-Hopf algebras are obtained by taking $H$ as the Hopf algebra of functions on a group $G$, 
endowed with the quasi-Hopf algebra structure provided by a non-trivial 
$3$-cocycle on $G$ (especially when $G$ is a finite cyclic group or the double dihedral group), or as being a quasi-Hopf algebra with 
radical of codimension two. In this way we uncover new classes  of basic quasi-Hopf algebras of even dimension, as well as new classes of tensor categories.}
