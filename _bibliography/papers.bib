  abstract={We complete the classification of the 6-dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras, by proving that any such algebra is semisimple. As byproducts, we provide examples of 6-dimensional quasi-bialgebras that are not semisimple as algebras, as well as the concrete quasi-Hopf structures of the 6-dimensional semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras previously classified by Etingof and Gelaki in terms of their category of representations. In total there are 15 quasi-Hopf algebras in dimension 6 which are not pairwise twist equivalent. },
